Problem Set Code from CS 62: Data Structure and Advanced Programming (Java)

First 5 problem sets here; brief descriptions:
*** GUI Provided In All Problem Sets ***
Problem Set 1:  Focuses mainly on inheritance/extending classes. Implementing a "gift catalog."
Problem Set 2:  Introduction to recursion. Wrote two methods (one brute force algorithm, and another algorithm
                at least one complexity class better) that find the number of triples in an array of integers
                which sum to a given number. Also took a first stab at a partition algorithm.
Problem Set 3:  First exposure to generics; wrote a generic Mergesort for an array of objects, completed a QuickSort
                of an integer array using (re-using) a partition algorithm. Then, wrote two generic QuickSorts- one 
                that is usable on an array of objects extending comparable, another that uses a comparator.
Problem Set 4:  Wrote a Linked List implementation, also writing an iterator whose methods run in theta(1) time. Also 
                wrote a generic ListIterator class (extending DLinkedList). 
Problem Set 5:  First exposure to the Queue data type; implemented a generic CircularQueue class. Additionally, wrote a
                program to solve a maze using recursive backtracking.
